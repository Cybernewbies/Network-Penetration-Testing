# BloodHound & SharpHound

BloodHound is an Active Directory (AD) reconnaissance tool that can reveal hidden relationships and identify attack paths within an AD environment.

SharpHound is the official data collector for BloodHound. It is written in C# and uses native Windows API functions and LDAP namespace functions to 
collect data from domain controllers and domain-joined Windows systems.

BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of Linkurious, compiled with Electron, with a Neo4j database fed by a C# data 
collector.

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory or Azure environment. Attackers 
can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use 
BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of 
privilege relationships in an Active Directory or Azure environment.


BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. As of version 4.0, 
BloodHound now also supports Azure. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible 
to quickly identify.

it will automatically execute it and it will generate zip file in the same location where sharpHound.exe is located.
- Now copy this zip file and transfer to your system for Analyzing Gathered Data With BloodHound interface via login.




Together with its Neo4j DB and SharpHound collector, BloodHound is a powerful tool for assessing Active Directory environments. 
The complex intricate relations between AD objects are easily visualized and analyzed with a Red Team mindset in the pre-built queries. 
An Offensive Operation aiming at conquering an Active Directory Domain is well served with such a great tool to show the way. 
Whenever the pre-built interface starts to feel like a harness, you can switch to direct queries in the Neo4j DB to find the data and 
relations you are looking for.
