IMPORTANT: This tool is used in order to find vulnerbility of network and its necessary to take first permission in written from your customer. 

The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because it's an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.


Particular vulnerabilities and exploits come along and make headlines with their catchy names and impressive potential for damage. EternalBlue is one of those exploits. Originally tied to the NSA, this zero-day exploited a flaw in the SMB protocol, affecting many Windows machines and wreaking havoc everywhere. Here, we will use EternalBlue to exploit SMB via Metasploit.


EternalBlue is an exploit most likely developed by the NSA as a former zero-day. It was released in 2017 by the Shadow Brokers, a hacker group known for leaking tools and exploits used by the Equation Group, which has possible ties to the Tailored Access Operations unit of the NSA.

EternalBlue, also known as MS17-010, is a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol. SMB allows systems to share access to files, printers, and other resources on the network. The vulnerability is allowed to occur because earlier versions of SMB contain a flaw that lets an attacker establish a null session connection via anonymous login. An attacker can then send malformed packets and ultimately execute arbitrary commands on the target.

 This lab is for exploit RCE on window XP with metaexpoloit.
