Password cracking with John the Ripper


Password cracking with JtR is an iterative process. A word is selected from the wordlist, hashed with the same hash algorithm 
used to hash the password, and the resulting hash is compared with the password hash. If they match, then the word picked from the 
wordlist is the original password.

JTR is a password cracking tool that comes stock with the Kali Linux distribution. This post will provide a very basic proof of concept 
for how to use JTR to crack passwords. If you don’t prefer the command line, Johnny is a graphical user interface GUI version of JTR.

Before we begin, you must have Kali Linux installed. For this demonstration, I’ll be using Kali Linux running as a virtual machine on my desktop. 
Additionally, you’ll need JTR, which should already be installed. If it isn’t, just use the following:


sudo john --wordlist=/home/greekcard/Desktop/wordlist.txt /home/greekcard/Desktop/hash.txt
            ----- path of wordlist-----------------------  --------path of hash file------
