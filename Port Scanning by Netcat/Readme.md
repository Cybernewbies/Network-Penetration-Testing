This lab is created by ghanimah.com (Canadian Cyber security online practice plafform) for education purpose .

With netcat you can scan a single port or a port range. The -z option tells nc to scan only for open ports, without sending any data and the -v is for more verbose information. If you want only the lines with the open ports to be printed on the screen, filter the results with the grep command .

Netcat is a command-line network tool used to open ports, associate a shell to a port, establish TCP/UDP connections, and more.

This tutorial shows how to use Netcat to scan ports on remote targets. Examples included in this tutorial explain individual port scan, scanning several ports, scanning port ranges, and banner grabbing using Netcat.

After Netcat examples, I added examples of the same scan types using Nmap and Nmap Scripting Engine for banner grabbing.
