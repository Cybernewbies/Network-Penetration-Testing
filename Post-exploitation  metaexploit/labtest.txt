Post-exploitation refers to any actions taken after a session is opened. A session is an open shell from a successful exploit or bruteforce attack. A shell can be a standard shell or Meterpreter. To learn more about the difference between each, see Manage Meterpreter and Shell Sessions.


Post exploitation is an important process in a penetration test as it allows the attacker to gather information from them system that he has exploited. A lot of penetration testers are using the metasploit framework modules for system exploitation

The main purpose of post-exploitation is to gain access to all parts of the target system without knowing the user or without being detected. If the attacker is detected, it will make all the effects useless and everything null.

    Meterpreter allows an attacker to control a victim's computer by running an invisible shell and establishing a communication channel back to the attacking machine. ...
    Meterpreter has all the “basic” features one would expect from a penetration testing tool.
    
    
The Metasploit framework is a very powerful tool which can be used by cybercriminals as well as ethical hackers to probe systematic vulnerabilities on networks and servers. Because it's an open-source framework, it can be easily customized and used with most operating systems.
