What is SNMP and how does it work?
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol used to monitor and manage the network devices connected over an IP. Different devices like routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, servers, CCTV cameras, and wireless devices communicate using SNMP.


Recommendations how to prevent it:

    Disable SNMP service if it is not required.
    If SNMP service is required, make sure that the default community strings are made complex.
    Make sure that SNMP service is not misconfigured with read-write authorization.
