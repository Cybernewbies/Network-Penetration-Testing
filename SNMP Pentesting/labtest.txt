This lab is created by Ghanimah for education purpose in order to how to learn SNMP PENTESTING. 

Why snmp pentesting is requied 

In order to required gathering all information 

IMPORTANT: TAKE PERMISSION IN WRITTEN BEFORE CARRY OUT PROCEDURE OF SNMP PENTESTING.

What is SNMP and how does it work?
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet Standard protocol used to monitor and manage the network devices connected over an IP. Different devices like routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers, servers, CCTV cameras, and wireless devices communicate using SNMP.


Recommendations how to prevent it:

    Disable SNMP service if it is not required.
    If SNMP service is required, make sure that the default community strings are made complex.
    Make sure that SNMP service is not misconfigured with read-write authorization.
 




PROCEDURE 

All procedure from root

information gathering from nmap
nmap -sU -p 161 172.30.3.0./24 
nmap -sU -p 161 172.30.3.0./24 --open

onesixtyone is another tool that can be used to bruteforce snmp community strings.
installation onesxityone from github 
git clone 
cd onesxityone 

Confirm installation from onesixtyone -h 



We have got SNMP community string as “public”. Many devices come with default SNMP community strings as public, private, etc. These community strings are used as credentials to read and write SNMP information depending on the configuration. When an attacker, finds an SNMP community string, he can read lots of juicy information from the target machine if the configuration is read-only(ro). An attacker can also make modifications if the configuration is read-write(rw).

These commands run 

onesixtyone  172.30.3.44 
snmp-check  172.30.3.44
